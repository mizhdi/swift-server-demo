## Building & Running

The following will clone and build an empty starter project and launch the server on port 8080 and 8181.

```
git clone https://github.com/PerfectlySoft/PerfectTemplate.git
cd PerfectTemplate
swift build
.build/debug/PerfectTemplate
```

You should see the following output:

```
[INFO] Starting HTTP server localhost on 0.0.0.0:8181
[INFO] Starting HTTP server localhost on 0.0.0.0:8080
```

This means the servers are running and waiting for connections. Access [http://localhost:8181/](http://127.0.0.1:8080/) to see the greeting. Hit control-c to terminate the server.

## Starter Content

The template file contains a simple "hello, world!" request handler and shows how to serve static files, compress outgoing content and start up more than one server at a time.

```swift
import PerfectLib
import PerfectHTTP
import PerfectHTTPServer

// An example request handler.
// This 'handler' function can be referenced directly in the configuration below.
func handler(data: [String:Any]) throws -> RequestHandler {
	return {
		request, response in
		// Respond with a simple message.
		response.setHeader(.contentType, value: "text/html")
		response.appendBody(string: "<html><title>Hello, world!</title><body>Hello, world!</body></html>")
		// Ensure that response.completed() is called when your processing is done.
		response.completed()
	}
}

// Configuration data for two example servers.
// This example configuration shows how to launch one or more servers 
// using a configuration dictionary.

let port1 = 8080, port2 = 8181

let confData = [
	"servers": [
		// Configuration data for one server which:
		//	* Serves the hello world message at <host>:<port>/
		//	* Serves static files out of the "./webroot"
		//		directory (which must be located in the current working directory).
		//	* Performs content compression on outgoing data when appropriate.
		[
			"name":"localhost",
			"port":port1,
			"routes":[
				["method":"get", "uri":"/", "handler":handler],
				["method":"get", "uri":"/**", "handler":PerfectHTTPServer.HTTPHandler.staticFiles,
				 "documentRoot":"./webroot",
				 "allowResponseFilters":true]
			],
			"filters":[
				[
				"type":"response",
				"priority":"high",
				"name":PerfectHTTPServer.HTTPFilter.contentCompression,
				]
			]
		],
		// Configuration data for another server which:
		//	* Redirects all traffic back to the first server.
		[
			"name":"localhost",
			"port":port2,
			"routes":[
				["method":"get", "uri":"/**", "handler":PerfectHTTPServer.HTTPHandler.redirect,
				 "base":"http://localhost:\(port1)"]
			]
		]
	]
]

do {
	// Launch the servers based on the configuration data.
	try HTTPServer.launch(configurationData: confData)
} catch {
	fatalError("\(error)") // fatal error launching one of the servers
}
```
